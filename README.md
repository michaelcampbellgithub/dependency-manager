# dependency-manager

This is a tool to manage your dependencies, much like [Dependabot](https://dependabot.com/), but for free!

## Environments supported

Currently, we are only working on supporting Python

Future releases are scoped for:
* Golang
* Javascript
* Docker images
* Helm charts
* Whatever else people want

However, please feel free to branch off & add support for your chosen stack if we're taking too long
